# fihris

Fihris is a modern **Library Admin Dashboard** built using **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

It allows admins to manage **Books and Authors** through full CRUD operations, with features like search, filtering, sorting, and dashboard statistics.
The system supports **English & Arabic (LTR / RTL)** layouts, **light/dark mode**, and uses **localStorage** as a simulated backend.

This project is designed to practice clean architecture, UI logic, and real-world admin dashboard behavior using pure JavaScript.
